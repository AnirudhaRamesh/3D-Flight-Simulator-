This is a basic 3D fighter simulator made in C++ using OpenGL.

The game has a square map with various checkpoint, obstacles, enemies, and collectibles sprawled across. 
Player wins the game if he/she marks all the checkpoints by destroying them. But be warned, a limited fuel supply, and health can come in your way.

Enemies Implemented  :
1) Ground Based Cannons 
2) Sky based special enemy.

Game has four checkpoints.

Plane can fire :
1)Bombs(dropped)
2)Missiles(launch corresponding to where the plane is aiming)

Be warned a series of volcanos split the map in two, crossing them is perilous, though possible. 
If a player does not want to risk certain death, he/she should take the long way round.

Random rings are randomly generated, collecting which player gets points.
Fuel tanks also randomly generated. Collect them to stay in the air longer.
